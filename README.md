# Real-time Face Analysis System


## Overview
A sophisticated computer vision application that performs real-time face detection and analysis using deep learning models. The system detects faces from webcam feed and provides instant analysis of age, gender, and emotional state.


## Technical Architecture
- **Face Detection**: MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)
- **Emotion Analysis**: Fine-tuned Vision Transformer model
- **Age/Gender Detection**: DeepFace framework with pre-trained models
- **Backend**: PyTorch + OpenCV


## Features
- Real-time face detection
- Emotion classification with confidence scores
- Age estimation
- Gender detection
- GPU acceleration support
- Low-latency processing


## Installation
Note that this project may contain files which requires potentially high computational power to run. Hence it is recommended to run it on a virtual environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```


# Install dependencies
'''bash
pip install deepface opencv-python torch torchvision facenet-pytorch transformers pillow numpy



## Usage
```python
python face_analysis.py
```
- Press 'q' to exit the application
- Ensure proper lighting for optimal detection


## Technical Implementation
The system employs a pipeline architecture:
1. Frame capture via OpenCV
2. Face detection using MTCNN
3. Feature extraction using transformers
4. Parallel processing of emotion/age/gender detection
5. Real-time visualization


## Future Developments
- [ ] Multi-face tracking
- [ ] Emotion trend analysis
- [ ] Integration with attention heat maps
- [ ] Expression-based interaction system
